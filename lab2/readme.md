This is my 2nd mini project which includes css also. it contains my personal portfolio webpage.
in this i had used header for heading which include the title.
then a nav tag for the navigation buttons like home, skils for diffrent sections.
now it came the turn of section tag to diffrentiate sections of intro, skills etc.
it contains table tag descibing my skills and a form tag to contact with me and button tag.
at last i used a fotter tag to define a footer section of my webpage. 

anybody can use my code to make and learn new projects, it is written in very well-mannared way and very understandable to learn.
